    <h1>Lesson 1</h1>

<b>World Wide Web</b>
<p>The web includes many pieces that communicate with each other. A web page is a text document written in a language known as <b>HTML</b>. Web browsers read documents, interpret, and display them.</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the basis for everything on the web. HTML includes text content, markup, refereences to other documents, and links to other pages. For example: This is the link to the <a href="udacity.com">Udacity Homepage</a>!</p>

<b>Vocabulary</b>
<p>Although it is not essential for programmers to memorize every little thing, there are a few terms that are necessary to know.<br><b>Tag:</b> A tag is contained with brackets and usually consist of both an opening and closing tag. Tags that do not include content and do not include a closing tag are called "void tags." An example of a void tag is the image element.</b><br><b>Element:</b> An element consists of everything within a set of opening and closing tags. An example of one element is the <em>italics</em/> element.<br><b>Attribute:</b> An attribute is a property of an HTML tag. For example, when I created the link to the Udacity homepage, I used the href attribute of an anchor tag. </p>

<b>Inline v Block</b>
<p>Certain elements are within text and are either applied to a specific line or create a new line. These are referred to as inline elements. Contrastly, elements that create and invisible box around content are considered block elements. For example, there are two different elements that create whitespace; break and paragraoph. Break tags insert a new line between the text, while paragraph creates a whole block of text that allows for attributes. For example, the <em>italics</em> element is considered an inline element.</p>

<b>HTML Documents</b>
<p>HTML documents provide a simple layout for a webpage. The layout contains tags, such as html, head, title and body. The head contains the title and styling like CSS and JS. Further, the body contains the main content of the entire webpage.</p>
